title: "On publishing opinions and content"
---
> Publishing one's views and work is an action I have come to admire dearly since granting even an iota towards the notion of putting together a blog of some kind.

This in mind, I find it increasingly difficult to face my fears and put something out there on the Internet, even if nobody is going to read it.

In absence of any real content as of present, here is the general code of ethics for the operation of this mediocre blog:

* No tracking of any kind
    - This entails that I have no idea if my pages are even being read.

* All edits and revisions and the like will be published at the foot of the post
    - No edits will be made "live" as it were. The original post will be preserved.

* No products will be named
    - All equipment, tools, etc. will be named only when necessary (such as in the description of my keyboard components).
