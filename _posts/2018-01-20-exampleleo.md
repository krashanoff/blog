Have you ever wondered what Leo's blog posts might look like?

> "Inspirational quote"

Welcome to the example. Now I'm not so sure if the animation you see left is completely necessary for the purposes of the blog, since it has really weird bounds, but I think that it would be pretty neat to have available. The main idea is to have a text-centric view on things, but still keep the reader engaged with the occasional image or big graphic (see below).

Of course there could always be some

`echo 'code' > code.txt`

and whatnot, but at the end of the day, it's about the rhetoric. As such, the font is simple, and the focus is going to be on the words. I also plan to write in multiple languages so 日本語を書けます、我能用中文写, y puedo usar español. This said, the superior viewing experience for this format is still on desktop (something that will be resolved in the near future).


Thank you for reading my ramblings.
